Countries around the world have different forms of governments and cultures which individually affect their growth and development. Multilateral organizations like the World Bank have certain standard indicators that can help to understand and compare the development of countries, especially economically. One such indicator is the GDP or the Gross Domestic Product.


Gross Domestic Product (GDP)- GDP is a measure of the value of all the final goods and services produced in a country, in a specific period. It is an indicator of the flow of the economy in a country. It can be expressed in terms of expenditure as:

GDP = Private Consumption + Investment (Business Expenditures) + Government Spending + Net Exports (Exports-Imports)


Along with the GDP, demographic indicators like population value and population density can give an overall look at the progress of a country over the years. This work aims to analyse and compare such indicators among the countries of the world from 2000 to 2022.

The population of the 215 countries have been visualized for comparison. Since the goods and services produced in a location are a result of human activities, the population is a major factor affecting the GDP.

It can be observed that China and India have had the highest average population till 2022. Among the countries with a significant population, the United States of America (USA) is one. It is to be noted that the USA has the highest average GDP and its significant population might be a major reason. Similarly, the sheer population of China and India feature them in the top 10 countries with the highest average GDPs.

This figure shows the relationship between the two socioeconomic indicators of the unemployment rate and education expenditure over the years. It also shows the data sorted continent-wise. The following observations can be made:

* There is a downward trend indicating an inversely proportional relationship between education expenditure and the unemployment rate. With the increase in education expenditure, the unemployment rate is generally going down.

* Europe has a lower average education expenditure than the other continents and has higher unemployment rates. It doesn't show any change over the years.

* Oceania has lower unemployment rates compared to the other continents.

* South America interestingly has an increasing unemployment rate with the increase in employment expenditure.

Hence, there is a correlation between the unemployment rate and education expenditure but there might not be a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.

The GDP distributions among the continents above show that North America has the highest range with many outliers while Africa has the lowest range. Examining the other indicators will only let us know why this is the case.

Since the data is available for the period from 2000 to 2022, the change in the sector-wise contributions to the GDP can be analyzed. The following insights can be derived from the above graph:

* The service sector has been contributing the most to the GDP over the years and there has been a growth since the year 2000. 

* The agriculture sector has seen a reduction in its contribution to the GDP over 22 years.

* The divide between imports and exports has seen an increase throughout the years.

* There are two dips in the curves around the years 2008 and 2020. These can be attributed to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively.

In conclusion, the socio-economic and developmental indicators of a country can help us understand the economic status of a country only to an extent. Since these standard measures are applied invariably to all countries, there is a chance that they can be inaccurate, owing to the unique characteristics of each country. Hence, any analysis using the GDP and associated indicators is only a reflection of the economy as opposed to being the exact reality.
