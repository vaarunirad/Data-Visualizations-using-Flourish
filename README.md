# An analysis of the socio-economic and developmental indicators around the world
## An interactive Data Visualization project using Flourish

Countries around the world have different forms of governments and cultures which individually affect their growth and development. Multilateral organizations like the World Bank have certain standard indicators that can help to understand and compare the development of countries, especially economically. One such indicator is the GDP or the Gross Domestic Product.


Gross Domestic Product (GDP)- GDP is a measure of the value of all the final goods and services produced in a country, in a specific period. It is an indicator of the flow of the economy in a country. It can be expressed in terms of expenditure as:

GDP = Private Consumption + Investment (Business Expenditures) + Government Spending + Net Exports (Exports-Imports)


Along with the GDP, demographic indicators like population value and population density can give an overall look at the progress of a country over the years. This work aims to analyse and compare such indicators among the countries of the world from 2000 to 2022.
